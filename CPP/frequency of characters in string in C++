A string is a one-dimensional character array that is terminated by a null character. Frequency of characters in a string is the number of times they occur in a string.
For example âˆ’

String: Football is a sport
The frequency of alphabet o in the above string is 3

A program to find the frequency of a particular alphabet is given as follows.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   char str[100] = "this string contains many alphabets";
   char c = 'a';
   int count = 0;
   for(int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
      if(str[i] == c)
      count++;
   }
   cout<<"Frequency of alphabet "<<c<<" in the string is "<<count;
   return 0;
}

Output

Frequency of alphabet a in the string is 4
