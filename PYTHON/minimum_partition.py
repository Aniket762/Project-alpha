Problem:
Given a set of integers, 
the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

If there is a set S with n elements, 
then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, 
Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
